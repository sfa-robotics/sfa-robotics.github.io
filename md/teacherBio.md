I am the Robotics teacher at Stephen F. Austin Middle School, a role I have proudly held since 2023. With a strong educational background in electronics and programming, I am equipped to guide students through an engaging curriculum that includes Lego Robotics, SeaPerch, and individual Technology Student Association (TSA) projects. Under my instruction, our students have consistently achieved remarkable success, advancing to international competitions and showcasing their skills on a global stage. At SFA, we are dedicated to fostering innovation and excellence in robotics, and I am excited to continue supporting our students' growth and achievements in this dynamic field.
