        <h3>Course Description for Robotics 1</h3>

        <p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Robotics 1</p>

        <h4>Course Overview:</h4>
        <p>Robotics 1 is an engaging and comprehensive introduction to the exciting world of robotics, designed for students eager to explore engineering principles and hands-on technological applications. This course provides a solid foundation in robotics through a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience.</p>

        <h4>Course Content:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Engineering Design Process:</strong> Students will learn the systematic approach to problem-solving and innovation used by engineers. This includes understanding requirements, brainstorming solutions, prototyping, testing, and refining designs.</li>
            <li><strong>Teaming:</strong> Emphasizing the importance of collaboration, students will work in teams to tackle complex projects, learning vital communication and teamwork skills essential in engineering and technology fields.</li>
            <li><strong>Lego Mindstorms EV3:</strong> Utilizing the versatile Lego Mindstorms EV3 platform, students will build and program robots, developing their skills in mechanical design, sensor integration, and autonomous programming.</li>
            <li><strong>SeaPerch:</strong> Students will dive into underwater robotics with the SeaPerch program, constructing and operating Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). This module enhances their understanding of marine engineering and robotics.</li>
            <li><strong>Arduino:</strong> Introducing microcontroller programming, students will use Arduino to design and implement electronic projects, learning about sensors, actuators, and circuit design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Competitions and Opportunities:</h4>
        <p>Robotics 1 actively participates in the <strong>Technology Student Association (TSA)</strong>, a Career and Technical Student Organization (CTSO) that provides students with opportunities to compete at the national level. Through TSA, students can showcase their skills, creativity, and innovation in various competitive events.</p>

        <p>Our program has a proud tradition of excellence, consistently sending students to <strong>international competitions</strong> in SeaPerch underwater robotics. These competitions not only challenge students to apply their knowledge and skills but also provide them with invaluable experiences and the chance to network with peers and professionals from around the world.</p>
